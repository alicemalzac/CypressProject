# Project Semana Agilizei 03

Project built according to the instructions of Professor Samuel Lucas (https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuellucass/) during the a week of classes everyday, for which we made a project in Cypress to automate the tests of a web platform.

The test web platform was dev.finances$ provided by rocketseat:https://devfinance-agilizei.netlify.app/, it is possible to:

- Add a new transaction, either incoming or outgoing money
- Remove actual transaction
- Check Inputs and Outputs, as well as the Balance obtained.

Thus, the tests were created:

- Register entries
- Register departures
- Remove input and output
- Validate balance with multiple transactions

Which can be checked in the cypress/integration/finances.spec.js folder
